# HomeKit Menu: Control Your Smart Home from the Mac Menu Bar

I built a small utility for anyone who uses HomeKit and wants quicker access to their devices on Mac.

**HomeKit Menu** sits in your menu bar and lets you toggle lights, switches, and other HomeKit accessories with a single click. No need to open the Home app or pull out your phone.

A few things it does:

- **Menu bar access** to all your HomeKit devices
- **Apple Shortcuts integration** — run your shortcuts right from the menu
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — assign hotkeys to any device
- **Sensor readings** — see temperature, humidity, and other sensor data at a glance
- **Dark mode support** — matches your system appearance

It's **free and open source**.

Requires macOS 14.0 or later.
